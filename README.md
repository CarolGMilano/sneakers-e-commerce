This is a simple responsive e-commerce project for seasonal sneakers, inspired by a project template from [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). While the initial idea was derived from the template, I have made design modifications and implemented new functionality.
